# My new programming language
So...  
I've been working on a project called Todots, and it's a programming language...  
Let me tell you the features!  
- a $ at the beginning means it is a statement that can have only one arg
- a ## at the beginning means it is a statement that can have multiple args
- a -- at the beginning means it is a special keyword; it is treated differently
- :: should be used before a function name is mentioned
- ;; should be used after a function name is mentioned
- -> means that a variable is being declared
Now, let's see a sample program:  
```
name -> input :: "Name: " ;;
print :: "Hello, " + name + "!" ;;
```  
Sample output:  
```
Name: World
Hello, World!
```
